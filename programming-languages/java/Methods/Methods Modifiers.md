# Method Modifiers

### Abstract
- When you declare a method abstract, a method body is always omitted. An abstract method can only be Class instance.

### Static
- Sometimes called a class method, rather than an instance method, because it's called directly on the Class instance.

### final
- A method that is final cannot be overridden by subclasses.
