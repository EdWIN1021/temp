# Polymorphism


### Runtime Polymorphism

- Runtime polymorphism is achieved through method overriding. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows objects of the subclass to be treated as objects of the superclass.

### Compile-time Polymorphism

- Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading. Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order).
