## Access Control


### public

- When a member of a class is modified by `public`, then that member can be accessed by any other code.

### private

- When a member of a class is specified as `private`, then that member can only be accessed by other members of its class.

### protected

- If you want to allow an element to be seen outside your current package, but only to classes that subclass your class directly, then declare that element `protected`

### package

- When a member does not have an explicit access specification, it is visible to subclasses as well as to other class in the same package.
