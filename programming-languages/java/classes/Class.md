## Class

- A class is template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.
- A class is declared by use of the class keyword.
- The data, defined within a class are called instance variables, because each instance of the class contains itâ€™s own ==copy== of these variables.
- The code is contained within methods.
- The methods and variables defined within a class are called members of the class.
- The `new` operator dynamically allocates memory during run time for an object and returns a reference to it.
