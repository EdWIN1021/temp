# POJO

- A plain old Java object is a class that generally only has instance fields.
- It is used to house data, and pass data, between functional classes.
- It usually has few, if any methods other than getters and setters.
- Many database frameworks use POJO's to read data from, or to write data to, databases, files or streams.

- A POJO also might be called a bean, or a JavaBean. 
- A JavaBean is just a POJO, with some extra rules applied to it.
- A POJO is sometimes called an Entity, because it mirrors database entities.
- Another acronym is DTO, for Data Transfer Object.
